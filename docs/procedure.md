# Procedures

## app-manage

`app-manage` procedure can create/update/destroy app distribution tracks easily. [example](procedure_app-manage.md) 

On CI, some of developers want to distribute applications for each branches by distributions.
However, the number of distributions are limited so they want to destroy the distributions when merged.

So `app-manage` can do the following actions.
  
- On feature branches, you can upload your app and distribute it. 
- When merging feature branches into master/develop/staging branches, this command destroy the distributions.
